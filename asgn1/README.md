My code doesn't loop infinitely letting the server take in multiple requests from the client. It doesn't implement http response codes 201, 403, and 404 correctly. When doing a GET request, it gets that weird
binary error, but it looks like it's okay to have that error from Piazza. The server can only take in ip address in the xxx.x.x.x form and of the like and can't handle hostnames.
